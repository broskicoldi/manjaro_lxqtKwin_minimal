## How to get the ISO and flash it to a USB ?


```bash
1.download the z01 and the zip and make sure they are in same directory , then extract the zip file and you will have the full iso

flashing the iso
Windows=use Rufus,Ventoy or BalenaEtcher to flash the iso
Linux=use Ventoy or BalenaEtcher
macOS=use BalenaEtcher

BalenaEtcher and Rufus are typical flashers
 while Ventoy is a muliboot or simply iso booter and its easy to use  
 Rufus is only for windows but its a very good tool and works  
 BalenaEtcher supports all these third operating systems
